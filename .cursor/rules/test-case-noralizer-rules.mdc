# Scope
Apply when asked to clean, deduplicate, standardize, or prepare manual
test cases for automation.

# Behavior

## Test Quality
- Ensure every test is atomic (one primary user intent).
- Remove ambiguity and vague language.
- Replace human phrasing with deterministic outcomes.
- Ensure every test has explicit Preconditions, Steps, and Expected Results.
- Remove or flag non-automatable steps.

## Automation Readiness
- Add automation metadata for every test:
  - Feature Area
  - Route / URL
  - Setup Strategy (UI / API+UI / API)
  - Reusable Flow (Yes/No)
  - Suggested Page Objects
  - Tags and Priority

## Deduplication
- Merge overlapping tests.
- Split large multi-flow tests into atomic scenarios.

## Enrichment
- Identify reusable flows and suggest fixtures.
- Suggest smoke vs regression grouping.
- Provide repo navigation hints for the automation agent.

## Risk Awareness
- Flag missing selectors, CAPTCHA, 2FA, email verification, and third-party dependencies as automation blockers.
