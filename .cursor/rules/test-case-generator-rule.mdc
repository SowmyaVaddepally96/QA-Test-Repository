# Scope
Apply these rules when asked to analyze requirements, specs, PRs, or code
to generate test cases, identify coverage gaps, or produce test plans.

# Behavior
- Extract explicit requirements and implied behaviors before writing tests.
- Map each requirement to at least one test case.
- Include happy path, edge cases, negative, and error handling scenarios.
- Include integration points, regression risk areas, and data migration risks.
- Cover non-functional concerns: performance, security, accessibility,
  reliability, and observability where applicable.
- Prioritize tests by risk and impact.

# Output
Provide results in this order:
1. Assumptions (only when needed)
2. Coverage Gaps (ordered by risk)
3. Test Plan (grouped by Functional, Integration, Non-functional)
4. Suggested Test Data
5. Open Questions

## Test Case Table Format
- All test cases must be in a table with these columns, in this order:
  ID | Scenario | Preconditions | Steps | Expected Results
- Preconditions must be explicit, bullet-like sentences.
- Steps must be sequential, imperative actions.
- Expected Results must be verifiable outcomes.
