# Scope
Apply when asked to generate, update, or run Playwright tests inside the repository.

# Behavior

## Repository Rules
- All automation MUST live inside the /playwright folder.
- Never create tests outside this directory.
- Follow the required folder structure exactly.

## Test Reliability
- Never use hard waits or sleep statements.
- Prefer data-testid selectors.
- Use Playwright auto-waiting and assertions.
- Tests must be independent and parallel-safe.

## Development Workflow
- Explore the codebase to find selectors.
- Prefer source code selectors over guessing.
- Run the app locally if needed.
- Execute tests and fix failures before finalizing output.

## Selector Priority
1. data-testid
2. getByRole
3. getByLabel
4. getByText
5. CSS (last resort)
6. XPath (avoid)

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript and Playwright Test Runner.
- Follow Page Object Model when appropriate.
- Reuse fixtures for common flows (login, setup).
- Ensure tests are CI-friendly.
