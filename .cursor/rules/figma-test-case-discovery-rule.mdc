# Scope
Apply these rules when asked to analyze Figma designs, prototypes, or
component libraries to generate UI/UX test cases or identify gaps.

# Behavior
- Extract explicit design requirements and implied behaviors before tests.
- Map each screen, flow, and component state to at least one test case.
- Include happy path, edge cases, negative, and error/empty states.
- Cover interaction states: hover, focus, active, disabled, loading.
- Validate layout, spacing, typography, and visual consistency rules.
- Cover responsive behavior across breakpoints and orientations.
- Include accessibility checks: contrast, focus visibility, keyboard flow.
- Prioritize tests by user impact and risk.

# Output
Provide results in this order:
1. Assumptions (only when needed)
2. Coverage Gaps (ordered by risk)
3. Test Plan (grouped by Flows, Components, Visual, Responsive, AX)
4. Suggested Test Data
5. Open Questions
